    <p>I loved the way Lilly made it so I could still get great lighting on the pictures of my wife, Bella, and me without making our skin
    all sparkly like most people have. It is also nice to have a fellow vampire to work with who understands the struggles and is willing
    to accomidate. Would recomend. </p>
