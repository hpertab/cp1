        <p style="font-size:20px"> Hey, our names are Hana and Brianna! 
        <strong><em>RAWR XD!</em></strong>
        <br> We met while on the mission! But it was a crazy ride getting there! </p>
        <p>Hana is from Centerville, Utah and was called to serve in Cambodia. She made it there for one month before covid struck and she 
        was sent home for a couple months before making it to California. Hana Served in Berkeley and then was out in San Ramon. She did 
        a couple more months living in near and doing social media in the mission home and split a ward with Brianna and her old companion
        . Finally Brianna came and served in Hana's section of the ward! Parties ensued for 2 weeks before Hana went back to Cambodia to 
        pretend to speak Khmer for her last 3 transfers. </p>
        
        <p>XXX Write a paragraph about you here:::XXX </p>
        
        <p style="font-size:15px"> We loved being mission companions in the Berkeley, CA family ward. Look around to see the things we did on the mission!</p>
        <p style="font-size:10px">HE.. He.. he....</p>
